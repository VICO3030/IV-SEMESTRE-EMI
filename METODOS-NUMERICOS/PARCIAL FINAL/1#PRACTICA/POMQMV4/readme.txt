Readme

This CD (or folder if you are using Render/Stair/Hanna) contains the setup program for the software and an HTML manual for the software. To view the HTML manual simply double click on the file named MANUAL and this will open your web browser and point you to the manual. The manual does not take much space (2 megabytes) and may be installed directly to the hard disk and accessed directly from the program.

INSTALLATION

To install the software:

  1.Insert the CD in drive D:. 
  2.From the Windows Start Button, select, Run. 
  3.In the box type D:POMQMsetup 
  4.Press [Enter] or click on [OK]. 
  5.Follow the setup instructions on the screen. Generally speaking, it is simply necessary to
    click [NEXT] each time that the installation asks a question. 

Default values have been assigned in the setup program, but you may change them if you like. The default folder is C:\Program Files\POMQMV3

The setup program will ask you for registration information such as your name, university, professor, and course. All items are optional except for the student/user name that must be given. This name cannot be changed later! To change the other information from within the program, use Help, User information. 

One option that the program will question you about is whether or not you want to be able to run the program by double clicking on the file name in File Explorer. If you say yes then the program will associate the proper extensions with the program name. This is generally very useful. Please note that the software installs some files to the Windows System directory. The installation will back up any files that are replaced if you select this option. 

If you see a message saying that something is wrong during installation and you have the option of ignoring, then choose this option. The program will likely install properly anyway. The message usually indicates that you are running a program or have run a program that shares a file with this software package.
